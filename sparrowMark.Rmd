## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(iris)
str(iris)

head(iris)
iris[95:105,]
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Further Testing with Header 1

For the basic information above, which was created when I first started the R markdown file, I modified the values to match datasets I would use.

*Testing Italics* and **testing bolds** for R markdown, specifically using the asterisks. Also, _testing italics_ and __testing bolds__ using the underscores as well.

## Further Testing with Header 2

An **unordered list** of animals:

  * Cats
    + Russian Blue
  * Dogs
    + Beagle
    + Pug
  * Lizards
    + Bearded Dragon

An __ordered list__ of tasks:

1. Take a shower
    + Wash face
2. Brush teeth
    + Floss
    + Mouthwash
3. Put together lunch

### Further Testing with Header 3
```{r}
tails <- c(3.8, 4.2, 4.3, 3.5, 2.9, 0.2, 3.6, 4.9, 4.5, 3.1)
mean(tails)
difference <- tails - mean(tails)
difference
```

`r length(tails)` cat tail lengths were provided and analyzed above.
